In React, Higher Order Components (HOCs) are a way to reuse component logic.
They are functions that take a component and return a new enhanced component with additional features or behavior. Imagine it as a function that wraps around your component to provide it with extra capabilities.

In this folder we have a very small example.
This is a basic example, but in real-world scenerios, HOCs are often used for more complex tasks like handeling authentication, managing state, or adding additional behavior to components without cluttering their code.
